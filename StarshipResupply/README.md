# Introduction 
This console application is used to calculate for all SW star ships, to cover a given distance, how many stops for resupply are required.

# Getting Started
Run the application and a console window will open.
Enter in a positive value of mega lights. You can use 'exit' or 'quit' to leave the application.

# Build and Test
No secrets to building


# Background 
As part of this code challenge you will be using an API available here: https://swapi.dev/

We want to know for all SW star ships, to cover a given distance, how many stops for resupply are required.

The application will take as input a distance in mega lights (MGLT).

The output should be a collection of all the star ships and the total amount of stops required to make the distance between the planets.

All other application details are at your own discretion.

Sample output for 1000000 input:

Y-wing: 74

Millennium Falcon: 9

Rebel Transport: 11

NOTE: The console application can be created in any language you wish to use (not limited to .NET languages).

Requirements

1) The completed code should be submitted along with

2) Accompanying documentation

3) Tests and instructions on the usage of the application.
